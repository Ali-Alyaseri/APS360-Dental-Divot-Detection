TThis project utilizes a custom-synthesized dataset, smile, which is an aggregation of three distinct publicly available dental radiography collections: dc1000, dental_radiography, and opg_xray. The source datasets were processed into a unified format, and the corresponding processing scripts are provided within each respective directory.

The smile dataset is structured in the YOLO annotation format. The complete, aggregated dataset is located in the smile/combined directory. For model training and evaluation, the dataset has been partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets following an 80:10:10 split ratio. These subsets are available in the smile/split directory. The script that performs this random allocation by selecting data from the combined directory and placing it into the split subdirectories is also located in the smile/combined directory.
