The dataset includes 5527 images.
Caries are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -23 and +23 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -24째 to +24째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -32 and +32 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
